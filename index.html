        My journey through computer science has been a long one. I have learned a lot during my studies, and I still have not fully decided what I want to focus 
        for my career. The field itself is so massive with opportunities in many different sectors. The courses here at SNHU have motivated me to pursue Full Stack 
        Development as my goal career. Aside from the course where I took the project from for the capstone project, I took two other courses related to web development. 
        Both courses used different ways of hosting their applications and both showcased different ways of handling the backend of a website. With my enhancements I was 
        able to showcase the skills of creating a fronted website that a user can interact with. The next enhancement I was able to utilize a data structure to house data 
        that was inputted into the web page. Once I reached the final enhancement, I was able to use Express JS, Node.JS and MongoDB to create the backend and to also 
        connect the frontend and backend using routes. With the database I was able to implement basic CRUD features that provided value to the user. 
        <br>
        <br>
        There is a course that I has provided us with come experience about Collaboration in a team environment. In the course CS 310 Collaboration and Team Project, 
        I was able to gain new skills when it came to working with Git and other team members. In this course we were tasked with working on a project with other classmates. 
        In the process we gained skills in working with working in local and remote repositories creating new branches to develop new features. When it came time to merge 
        the branch back into the main branch, we needed to be able to communicate with our team to avoid conflicts. When there were conflicts, we needed to decide what code 
        needed to be kept and what code could be removed. This course involved having clear communication with the team to prevent any problems. Working with another course 
        I gained the skills to work through the software development lifecycle. In this course we learned about the agile methodology and the requirements given to us by 
        user stories and the stakeholders. It is important to have the skill to be able to interpret the requirements presented. Now when it come to data structures and 
        algorithms, I did not take the course at SNHU, but I still took the course at a different university. Here I gained the skills to understand the important of 
        algorithms and data structures. Here we learned about the different kinds of sorting algorithms and their Big-O notation. This is crucial to understand to choose 
        the best algorithm and the fastest and more efficient data structure. Throughout the computer science program, I have come across several different kinds of 
        databases. In the DAD 220 I worked with SQL. In the CS 465 course we use MongoDB to perform CRUD operations on the administrative portion of the website. With the 
        second Full stack course, CS 470, we used DynamoDB to save the data from the CRUD operations. While we became familiar with all the different types of software and 
        frameworks we also needed to take into consideration the security of the code we were writing. For my artifact in the course IT 145 I learned that there needed to 
        be input validation added when the program was intended to take in data. In CS 305 we learned that that it was important to write secure code as well that had no 
        vulnerabilities. Making sure the code is free of errors and includes comments help ensure the security of an application.

        For the Capstone I decided to choose one artifact to present one cohesive application that provides some value for the client. For the first artifact I decided to refactor 
        the original code in a new language. The goal was to create a usable user interface that still provided the same features. This step can tie into the 3rd outcome because 
        I chose to use standard practices to solve the problem for the client. The next enhancement focused on using a data structure to hold the data that we were collecting on 
        the form. The third enhancement then expands on this and adds a database to the application. The application used Express JS and Node.js to connect to the MongoDB database. 
        This portion covers the 4th outcome because I am using Express JS as a middleware tool to makes routes for the frontend. I also used the tool node.js to connect the client
        side to the server side. Once the application was finished the 2nd outcome was met because I created written and visual website that has been adapted to better serve the 
        employees of the company. The outcome regarding security was met because I used a .env file to hide the username and password needed to connect to the MongoDB client.

        <h1>Enhancement #1</h1>
        <p>
          For my artifact I decided to enhance the project we worked on in IT 145. For this project we were tasked with creating a system that allowed for a company, 
          that focuses on search and rescue animals, to be able to register and track the progress of different animals. I worked on this project about year ago 
          in the IT 145 course. I selected this artifact because it aligned well with my future career goals. I wanted to work on something that was not necessarily 
          developed. This project was just the back bones of a work website. This artifact focused on the use of Object-Oriented Programming, and I wanted to continue 
          using this for my artifact. For this artifact I wanted to redo it with a new language. This project was initially written in Java, but I wanted to show my 
          proficiency using HTML/CSS and JavaScript. My goal was to create a usable interface that the company would be able to use. The artifact started out as a program 
          that could only be used within an integrated development environment, but with my enhancements it can be used as a normal website. 
          <br>
          <br>
          For this first enhancement I aimed to pursue two different outcomes. The first outcome focused on security. I have not implemented much security yet and plan to 
          add more security measures in the future. I have planned to use this artifact for the other two enhancements, so I still plan on achieving this outcome. The second 
          outcome involved using innovative technical skills to provide value with this solution. I believe that this outcome has been met because I took a product that only 
          ran in an IDE to using tools that created a website that met the users’ goals.
          <br> 
          <br>
          I used a variety of different tools to complete this enhancement. I used Visual Studio Code to write the code. I used GitHub to store the code and track changes.
          For this project I realized that it is difficult translating a program from one language to another. It took some time figuring out how to translate the different 
          classes over to a new language. I had some issues when it came to variable storage and some plans I had to change last minute. I initially planned to add different 
          pages to the website, but I had issues with adding portions of html code to a part of the website that technically did not exist. Ultimately, I decided to stick to 
          one screen for now. I also had issues with storage since the storage only existed while the website was running. I do plan on adding more storage options with future 
          enhancements.

        <h1>Enhancement #2</h1>
        <p>
          For the second enhancement I decided to working with the artifact from the IT 145 course. For this course we were tasked with finishing the code to develop a 
          menu system for a company that worked with search and rescue animals. The goal of the system was to allow the company to enter the animals into the system and 
          track their training progress. Also within the code the code there was the option for the company to filter through the animals and see which ones were already 
          reserved for missions. I chose this artifact because I saw potential with the product. In its current state it was not very useful for the client. Is started by 
          creating a website page that allows a user to navigate the UI and enter a new animal into the system. For this portion of the artifact, I was able to add in a list 
          of objects that will help me keep the data taken in from the forms organized. I considered this to be the best option to hold and organize complex data. The objects 
          themselves hold the individual animals which have the traditional key and value style. 
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>
            Course Outcome: 
            <br>
            <br>
            “Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that 
            deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals.”
          </b>
          <br>
          <br>
          For this enhancement I had planned to meet the outcome above. I believe that achieved this outcome by being able to be innovate with using the OOP style to save data and 
          then add it into our list of objects. This help deliver the solution that the project aimed to achieve. The project goal was to create a system that allowed the user to 
          manage and update the animals in the system. Being able to include the data structure has brought value to the whole project. 
          <br>
          <br>
	        Throughout the process I did hit some road bumps that will need to be addressed in future versions. I had some difficulty presenting the data from the objects back into the 
          tables without duplicating the data that was already present. The difficulty came from creating the html element on the spot rather than creating it after the fact. I needed to 
          find a way to have the tables in my website to update only with the new data that has been entered. I still also had some issues with the CSS and getting things to look how I 
          wanted. I learned that these kinds of enhancements cannot be rushed and should be planned out beforehand. I learned how to manipulate the DOM of an html site using JavaScript.

        <h1>Enhancement #3</h1>
        <p>
          This artifact is one that I have been working on with the past artifacts. This artifact was initially made about a year ago with the IT-145 course here at SNHU. This project involved 
          using Object Oriented Programming and using Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism and Abstraction with classes. The project aimed to provide a system that allowed user to enter a 
          rescue animal and keep track of their training and reserve status. The system included dogs and monkeys as their main rescue trainee animals. While deciding what project I wanted to 
          enhance I notice that this project had a good backbone to turn into a usable product. I noticed that the program was missing a User Interface and some sort of database. I was able to 
          add the frontend with the first artifact and with the third artifact I handled connecting the frontend to the backend. I showcased the experience I have by incorporating Express Js to 
          handle the routing between the frontend and the backend. I also used node.js to handle the server-side code of the application. Incorporated in the current version of my web application 
          I added a table that requests the data from the Database. Within the table I added the ability for the user to press a button to delete an item from the table and the database. I was able 
          to deliver a working product that incorporates useful features that fulfill the clients’ specifications. 
          <br>
          <br>
	        <b>
            For this artifact I planned to meet outcome below:
            <br>
            <br>
            “Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value 
            and accomplish industry-specific goals.”
            <br>
            <br>
          </b>
          I was able to combine the use of different technologies to create a full stack application that provided a solution for a problem. In this case the client was Grazioso Salvare and their 
          mission was to have system to manage their rescue animals. I kept up with industry standards and left useful comments within my code to explain what was done. I was able to deliver a 
          solution to a problem that the client had. 
          <br>
          <br>
          Working on this enhancement I found myself stuck in some portions. I had implemented Express or Node.js by myself before so it took some time to look over the documentation and familiarize 
          myself with the frameworks. I learned that it is not difficult to fully implement the fronted and the backend together, but it does take some getting used to. Previously I had only worked 
          with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and had some experience with express in other courses I had taken. The biggest takeaway I had was that it takes patience to learn and understand something that 
          we may not have a lot of experience in. I expect to further my learning in this field and practice more so that I can master these skills.
